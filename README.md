# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Repository which contains all the problems/questions that I have solved from various platforms like GeeksForGeeks , HackerRank , CodeChef etc in a topic-wise manner. The thought behind creating this repository was to have everything in one place in a systematic way (since there are so many resorces and its sometimes confusing) and hence helpful for beginners in probelm solving using DS and Algo.
